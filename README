# Simple Test Results Repository

This repository automatically stores test results generated by [Simple Test AI](https://simple-test-tau.vercel.app/) - an AI-powered smart contract testing platform.

## 🔍 What Gets Stored

Each test generation creates a folder containing:

1. **contract.sol** - The original Solidity smart contract submitted for testing
2. **tests.js** - The AI-generated Hardhat test suite
3. **results.json** - Test execution results including:
   - Pass/fail status for each test
   - Gas usage metrics
   - Execution time
   - Error messages (if any)
4. **metadata.json** - Information about the test generation:
   - Timestamp
   - Contract hash
   - AI model used
   - Processing time

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Users submit their Solidity contracts at https://simple-test-tau.vercel.app/
2. Our AI analyzes the contract and generates comprehensive test cases
3. Tests are executed using Hardhat framework
4. Results are automatically uploaded to this repository
5. Users receive a direct link to their test results

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- All test results are public and transparent
- Contract hashes are used for folder names (not contract names)
- Sensitive information should not be included in contracts
- Results are retained indefinitely for reference

## 📊 Test Categories

Generated tests typically cover:

- **Deployment & Setup** - Initial contract state verification
- **Basic Functions** - Core functionality testing
- **Edge Cases** - Boundary conditions and error handling
- **Security** - Common vulnerability checks
- **Gas Optimization** - Usage metrics for optimization
- **Events** - Event emission verification

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **AI Model**: Google Gemini for test generation
- **Testing Framework**: Hardhat with Chai assertions
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (multiple versions supported)
- **Storage**: GitHub for permanent, versioned storage

## 📈 Statistics

- Tests generated: Updated daily
- Average test suite size: ~20-30 tests per contract
- Success rate: >95% compilation success
